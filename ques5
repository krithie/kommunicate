If I worked in a software company, I would choose person A, who has had experiences in the workplace through internships and projects because that shows that person to already have the work ethic and mindset to work in a comapny.
The second person would be person P, who is highly adaptable and learns new things with zest. She has the ability to identify problems and work on a creative solution while learning new technologies to do so.
